**Components of web application architecture**
Web applications vary in complexity and functionality, which directly impacts the number of layers and components involved in their architecture. Some apps are simple enough to operate as a monolithic structure, where the entire architecture is centralized in one place. However, most web applications consist of multiple components that work together.

Typically, web application architecture is divided into two main groups: user interface components and structural web components. The structural components include both client-side and server-side elements, which interact to provide the necessary functionality.

The architecture of a system can also include both existing third-party services and custom-built solutions. It’s essential to highlight that every architecture is multi-layered, and in this article, we will cover only the fundamentals to explain why understanding architecture is so important. However, don’t expect an in-depth technical explanation here — this article aims to provide an introduction. If you are interested in specific approaches, you can explore them through other articles in our blog or with the help of our consulting services.
