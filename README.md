**What is web application architecture?** 
Let’s start from the very beginning and talk a little about some basic things you need to know about web application architecture. Web application architecture is the foundational framework that shapes the design and development of a web application. It consists of procedures and best practices that determine how various elements of the application — such as the frontend, backend, and database — work together to provide the necessary functionality.

In simpler terms, it’s like a layout that assures smooth interaction between the visible elements users interact with, the server-side logic, and data storage. The goal is to build a seamless, scalable system that meets the application’s functional requirements while also concentrating on performance, security, and ease of maintenance.
